# Password_Generator_Random 

# Task: To create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

  # Steps:
  * added prompt for the user request password options and return an array of selected characters and a check to see if task completed
  * Added code for the check of the length of the password and if it is too short or too long then the user is prompted to enter a new length and return an array of selected characters and a check to see if task completed.
  * Add the options and the prompts for the user to select the character types and return an array of selected characters and a check to see if task completed.
  *added check for characters used and if not selected then the user is prompted to select at least one character type and return an array of selected characters and a check to see if task completed
  * Added function to randomise the output of the password and return the password and a check to see if task completed 
  * Added code for the chack of character types and possible characters based on user input.

    Still a lot to learn and understand about Java script and how to use it to create a password generator, but I hope I managed to get something working.

    Have a great day, thanks for reading :)
